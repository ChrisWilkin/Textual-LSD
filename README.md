Textual Lyric Sentiment Detection
-----------------------------------------------
A transformer based architecture converted into a multi-task learning model that aims to categorise songs into the four quadrants of emotion based on Valence, Arousal and Dominance scores.
We build upon previous research by adding the third dimension of dominance (as more commonly used in psychological reports) to investigate its impact on classification performance.
This project is still under development, but contains a working network, as well a data preprocessing scripts, scraping code for retrieving lyrics off the internet, and several custom classes for managing aspect such as the dataset and vocabulary.
